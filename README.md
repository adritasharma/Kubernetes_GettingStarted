### What are Containers?

Containers are all about portable software.
Technology that allows to run software on a variety of systems, including a developer’s laptop, all the way to a production system.
Containers wrap software in a standardized environment that allows it to run consistently on varied machines.


### What is Orchestration?

Container Orchestration refers to processes used to manage containers and to automate the management of containers.
Deploy new code with zero down time.
For example:

• I want to start up a set of five containers in production.

• I could spin up each container manually.

• Or, I could tell an orchestration tool like Kubernetes that I want five containers, and let the tool do it.

### What are Containers Used For?

 **Software Portability** – Running software consistently on different machines.
 
 **Isolation** – Keeping individual pieces of software separate from one another.
 
 **Scaling** – Increasing or decreasing resources allocated to software as needed.
 
 **Automation** – Automating processes to save time and money.
 
 **Efficient Resource Usage** – Containers use resources efficiently, which saves money.

### What is Docker?

- Docker is primarily a container runtime. 
- Container is not a tool or technology. It is  a concept. Docker is the tool to implement that concept.
- It is a piece of software that is designed to implement and support containers.
- Docker allows us to run containers on systems. 
- It also offers a variety of tools for creating and managing containers and container images. 
- It is a Platform to build, ship and run apps

### What are other Container runtimes?

- Rkt (Pronounced Rocket)
- Containerd

### What is Kubernetes?

- Kubernetes is a container orchestration tool. 
- It allows easy build and manage container infrastructure and automation.
- It has features  like self-healing applications, automated scaling, and easy automated deployments.

### What are other orchestration tools?

- Docker Swarm
- Kubernetes
- Zookeeper
- Marathon Based
- Nomad
- **Cloud Orchestration Solutions**

    Cloud providers such as Amazon Web Services, Microsoft Azure, and Google Cloud Platform also offer built-in container orchestration solutions, including cloud-native Kubernetes implementations! 
    For example: 
    
    - Red Hat OpenShift
    - Amazon Elastic Container Service 
    - Amazon ECS for Kubernetes
    - Azure Kubernetes Service 
    - Google Kubernetes Engine
